            <h2>About the Program</h2>
            <p>The conference is being conducted to honor great Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan on his birth
                anniversary, which is also celebrated as National Mathematics Day (22nd December) in India. The
                conference is proposed to be conducted in online mode from 22nd December 2025 to 23rd December 2025 (02
                days).
                This conference aims to bridge the gap between theoretical mathematics, allied sciences and their
                practical applications in agriculture, science and technology. This conference will hold significant
                value for faculty members, research scholars, and students by enhancing their understanding of how
                mathematical modeling, and advances in allied sciences can be effectively applied to solve complex
                problems in agriculture, environmental science, engineering, and technology.
                The participants will gain valuable exposure to current research trends, and interdisciplinary
                applications. The conference also provides a platform for knowledge exchange and networking among
                faculty across institutions.
                This conference is a step forward in fostering innovation, encouraging collaborative research, and
                promoting excellence in higher education.</p>
            <b>Objectives of the Conference</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Gain interdisciplinary insights into the applications of allied sciences and applied mathematics for
                    forecasting models like weather prediction, which are crucial for agricultural planning.</li>
                <li>Develop skills in mathematical biology models and their interactions within ecosystems to study
                    biodiversity and conservation.</li>
                <li>Gain insights regarding drug kinetics and optimization of treatments, mathematical tools which
                    assist in analyzing soil data and optimizing irrigation schedules.</li>
                <li>Explore recent trends and research opportunities, fostering collaborative and impactful work at the
                    interface of mathematics and applied sciences.</li>
                <li>Explore recent trends in advanced materials for solar energy conversion and sustainable technology.
